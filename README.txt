Hello welcome to my final project

I made a game about a fish in the sky.

The main_fish file contains the game, while the rest are classes. In the image folder are all the images I used.

To play the game use the arrow keys. 

If you jump on a bird, you kill it. If the birds hit you, the game resets to the first level

If you fall in lava the game also resets. 

To win the game you must collect all the rainbows. If you get to the end without getting all the rainbows,
use the lava to go back and collect the rest.

Rainbows and birds will not reset after you die.

The top left displays the current level and your score.
